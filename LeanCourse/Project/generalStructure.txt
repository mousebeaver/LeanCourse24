proof of overall goal:
------------------------------------------------
"<=" is already done

"=>": Let V be irreducible for representation r. Let g be a group element.
Then, r(g)*r(h) = r(h)*r(g). Therefore, r(g) is a homomorphism (endomorphism, in this case).
Since V is irreducible and r(g) != 0, r(g) is an isomorphism.
r also is given by multiplication by a scalar, but such an homomorphism has every one-dimensional subspace as invariant subspace.
Therefore, V is one-dimensional.
