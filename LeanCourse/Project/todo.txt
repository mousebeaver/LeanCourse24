- link the two notions of direct sum
- link the two notions of ReprHoms (module version is probably given)
- do what is listed as "Future work" in https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Maschke.html

- check Schr√∂er lecture notes for other interesting theorems/definitions
  -? write completely reducible representations as direct sums of irreducible sub-representations
  -? define the multiplicity of a irreducible subspace of a completely reducible representation
