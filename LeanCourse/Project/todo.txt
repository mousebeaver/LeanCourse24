- somehow convert from
  ComplementedLattice (Submodule (MonoidAlgebra k G) V) to
  ComplementedLattice (Submodule (MonoidAlgebra k G) ρ.asModule)
  via asModuleEquiv?
- remove sorrys in ofSubmodule_ofComplIsCompl
- do what is listed as "Future work" in https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Maschke.html
  - write completely reducible representations as direct sums of irreducible sub-representations
  - reformulate maschke that way (should be easy)
- check Schröer lecture notes for other interesting theorems/definitions
  -? finite groups are abelian if and only if their irreducible representations are of dimension one. -> characterise all representations of finite abelian groups
