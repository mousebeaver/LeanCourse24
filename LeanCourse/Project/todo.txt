remarks by van doorn:
- find a theorem in mathlib about dimensions of modules (probably does not exist)
- use structure instead of class (optional)

rename "subspace" etc. to "submodule" etc. whenever it is necessary

- connect two kinds of representations in Mathlib (as a homomorphism, as a module)
-> "coercion" from homomorphism to module (already given in Mathlib)
-> "coercion" from module to homomorphism (probably not given in Mathlib, research)
-> link the two notions of irreducibility
-> introduce direct sums for homomorphisms, link the two notions of direct sum
-> link the two notions of ReprHoms (module version is probably given)
-> introduce semisimplicity for homomorphisms
-> do what is listed as "Future work" in https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Maschke.html

- prepare presentation ;)

- check Schr√∂er lecture notes for other interesting theorems/definitions
