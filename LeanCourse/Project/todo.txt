- link the two notions of direct sum
- link the two notions of ReprHoms (module version is probably given)
- do what is listed as "Future work" in https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Maschke.html

- check SchrÃ¶er lecture notes for other interesting theorems/definitions
  -? write completely reducible representations as direct sums of irreducible sub-representations
  -? define the multiplicity of a irreducible subspace of a completely reducible representation
  -? decompose the regular representation and find all irreducible representations in it (specify)
  -? finite groups are abelian if and only if their irreducible representations are of dimension one. -> characterise all representations of finite abelian groups
