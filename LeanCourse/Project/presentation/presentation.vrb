\frametitle{The translation in Mathlib}
Irreducibility of representations translates to simplicity of modules.\\
\pause
Things like the theorem of Maschke are not formulated for \verb+Representation+s, but for modules over algebras.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+Representation.asModule+ translates \verb+Representation+ to algebra
\item \verb+Representation.ofModule+ translates algebra to \verb+Representation+
\end{itemize}
